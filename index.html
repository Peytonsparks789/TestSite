                <p>Ever since I was young, I have always loved to tinker with computers and learn what all I can accomplish using the technology that I have been provided. As I grew my skill-set, I had decided that I wanted to work within the development side of computing, due to the fun challenge of creating something unique from scratch using technology that I've used all my life while learning to solve complex challenges.</p><br>

                <p>I also knew that I wanted to try to pass this knowledge I had received to others so that they could learn too. As I knew part of the job in <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> is to not only to help resolve issues but help educate the end user, I figured CSIT would be perfect for me as I could hone my skills while attempting to help educate others on topics that interested me.</p><br>

                <p>I have worked on many different projects throughout my career, from learning to build and analyze existing algorithms to building small applications on the side purely as a hobby. With my love for development I decided to test the waters and try something new through web development. I quickly learned that this was something I enjoyed very much, and decided to focus on this aspect of development during my time at Trine. I figured this would help to provide the perfect opportunity to do exactly what I wanted as I could spend my time developing things that people would see and be able to interact with, while also potentially using the platforms I create to help educate people on topics that interest me and help fight technological illiteracy.</p><br>
